#The Ghosts of Yarrow

An exploration in creating a  hybrid text adventure / role playing game using Atom-Shell
and JavaScript.

##Status

The storyline, requirements and other details are being tracked in the notes directory
of this repository.

The games code are taking a backseat at the moment due to the fact that I want to explore 
the storyline and world before I really do a deep dive.
