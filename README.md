#The Ghosts of Yarrow

An exploration in creating a  hybrid text adventure / role playing game using Atom-Shell
and JavaScript.

##Status

Not playable, still in the early stages of development. The old code has been discarded
and is being rewritten.

##Note

This is a note on running this in Atom-Shell. The way I run this app is by putting
this code in a folder called app that is placed under the resources folder of Atom-Shell.

See:

https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/blob/master/docs/tutorial/application-distribution.md

This code will not work by dragging it into the Atom-Shell default app because the
plugins won't be able to be found due to path problems. The plugins path will try
to be resolved relative to the default app which is not correct.
