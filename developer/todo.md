#todo

- Finish merging code from old codebase and fix it up where needed. Obviously
  things are changing quite a lot so some of it may no longer be relevant and/or
  need to be rewritten.
- Go over notes and start gettting things as far as story settled. Start writing
  more of the story and initial landscape of what will transpire during the
  start of the game.
- Work on armor sets, weapons, items, magic, etc...
- Work on and think about the game play aspects and how a text adventure can
  be free roaming.
- I have a bunch enemy/animals/monster ideas listed in my notebook that need
  to be digitized, LOL!
- Look at adding an array for the source files of a plugin so that when a plugin
  loads it can be composed of multiple source files.
- Need a UI for when new places are discovered and quests are started.
- Need to figure out the UI that will go in the right pane.
- Start developing the city maps
- Start developing the world map in and around where the game starts
- The start screen plugin needs to allow for loading / starting a new game.
- Need to be able to load plugins from users home directory (like how Atom does
  it).
- Need to figure out what the game save file will look like. It will be JSON but
  all of the components need to be figure out and how I want to save world
  information relative to the dynamic stuff happening in the world.
- Some aspects of the game will be generated randomly (like some treasure chest
  locations, item placements). Need to figure out when/how often that kind of
  code runs.
- When developing the world map and city maps start placing some loot around so
  it can be found by the player.
- Add level and experience points to player object.
- Think about and figure out how the leveling system will work.
- Think about and figure out what the quests data structure looks like and what
  things need to be there.
- Think about and figure out how the maps and game data will work, I've kind of
  already got this worked out but it needs to be thoroughly tested.
- Develop a quest manager plugin so a player can see all the quests started and
  obtain information about them.
- Develop an inventory manager plugin.
- (Maybe) Develop a command manager plugin for key combo management.
- Develop a notes manager so players can log notes as they play the game,
  incorporate the notes into the game save file (allow importing/exporting).
- Develop an alchemy manager plugin.
- Develop an enchantment manager plugin.
- Develop an instructures/game information plugin.
