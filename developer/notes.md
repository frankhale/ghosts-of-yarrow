#The Ghosts of Yarrow

**NOTE: Picture the land and scenery as if it were rendered in the style of
The Elder Scrolls Oblivion or Skyrim. The scenery is absolutely beautiful and
magnificent.**

This is a placeholder for developing the storyline to my text adventure
game under the same title as this file. Additionally this will outline the
requirements and various aspects of the game.

As I think about this more and more I assume that this file will be bits
of fragments and ideas because the story won't necessarily read like a
book. There will be twists and turns and side quests and such.

Need to figure out a way to create a map that can be easily changed and
prototyped here. I guess I'll just have to use text but maybe there is
something else I can use? Having a map of Yarrow will help in figuring out
the story locations.

~~Actually come to think of it I think I'll hand draw a map and just scan
it in as a graphic.~~

**NOTE: This isn't necessarily meant to read from top to bottom.**

You find yourself in the middle of a field, it's nighttime and you don't
remember how you got here. The summer moon is full and it's light fills the
cloudless sky. You notice that the strong illumination of the moon allows
you to see fairly well. You look around and to your east, west and south lay
a treeline approximately 100 yards away. To your north you see a series of
lights that may be coming from a village. They seem farther than the woodline,
maybe 4 or 5 times as far. Judging from the well lit area the ground appears
to be fairly flat with 2 - 3 foot tall grass at least in your immediate area.

A short fat candle lay at your feet.

You are dressed in drab leather pants, a cloth shirt, a pair of boots and
carrying a backpack.

You take your backpack off to examine the contents of it. Within it you find
a flint, a cloth, a torn map, 10 gold coins and some small food items and a
flask of water.

Walking towards the lights to your north took approximately 30 - 45 minutes
due to your uneasiness with the terrain and the fact that it's night. The
bright luminance of the moon was not enough to ease your weariness as you
travesed the land. Your suspicions of the lights being from a village are
correct. You stand approximately 100 feet from a row of buildings and you
can see the lights shining from windows and street lights.

Your quest is to rescue sacred artifacts left by 8 members of Yarrow's
high council. These men and women died in a horrendous attack against the
sovereignty and liberty of Yarrow and are said to be haunting various locations
around the island. The attack was expertly crafted and executed leaving
no trace to track down the perpetrators. You'll need to locate the haunted
areas and trace down the clues that will lead to the lost artifacts. Once
equipped with the artifacts you'll need to take them to the high cleric so
that they can be used in an ancient ritual seance in order to communicate
with the martyred high council members so that the individuals who caused
the heinous act can be brought to justice.

You'll need to earn some money so you can buy supplies.

You'll need to find a place where you can sleep at night.

You'll need to conquer the skill of meditation. This will be vital in allowing
you to open yourself up to receive information about your quest.

The lights you suspected were a city, were indeed a city and it's a good
thing because you are tired and need to rest. You'll need to look for a safe
place to sleep. Head for the monastery, I'm sure they will have warm place
for you to rest.

You've found the town of Irdana.

Irdana is a small coastal town positioned near the Wispful bay.

Explore the town and talk to as many people as you can. Find out as much
information as you need to get you started on your quest.

##The Woodline South Of The Players Starting Point

You turn south and start walking through the tall grass. You walk about 25
yards and notice that your feet are starting to get wet. The ground is very
wet in this location. It's perhaps 1 and a half feet deep. Do you want to
continue on or turn around and play it safe or continue on?

###NOTE

*The woodline to the south has a swampy area which is in front of it. If
the player continues and makes the trek through the swampy area then he
will eventually come out of it and reach the forest. About 30 feet within
the woodline is a hollowed out tree which leads to a chamber that contains
valuable items that the player will surely want for his journey.*

If the player continues south passed the hollowed out tree he will come to
a beach because the players starting position is on a small peninsula.

##To the East and West of the Starting Position

The player can travel to his east or west from the starting position. If
he does he will encounter a grassy area similiar to his starting position
followed by the woodline.  If he travels through the woodline he'll come to
a beach because the area that the player starts is on a small peninsula.

##Companion NPC

NOTE: I want to develop a companion NPC that will assist the main character
throughout the game. I want a deep friendship and bond to be developed
between the two. The NPC will be located in Irdana which is the closest city to
the players starting position. The NPC cannot be killed and will available or
with the player throughout the game. This NPC will have a vast knowledge of the
country, cities and various aspects of the game world. The NPC can help the
player in many ways for instance can be dispatched to gather goods, food, etc..
as well as dispatched to gather information.

#Requirements

NOTE: Okay so I am seriously influenced by games in the series of The Elder Scrolls, Ultima 4 and 5
and I'll likely incorporate some of those aspects here.

- Map builder: I'm going to need a map builder of some sort that will allow for creating the 2D arrays as
easily as possible and one that I can use for posting what the map looks like.

- Free roaming
  - Internally the map will be 2D top down and act like an old school RPG but the player won't see a map, instead only see text to let him know what is going on in the game.
- Player leveling
  - Skills:
    - Meditation
    - Pick Pocket / Theft
    - Bribery
    - Magic
- Lots of items to find, receive as a reward or buy
- No limit to how much loot the player can carry
- Dungeons, caves, camps
* Time system (think of how time was kept in Ultima 4 or 5, not real time, events can be triggered based on time)
- Battle system
  - Will work similiar to how battles worked in Lord of Ultima. Behind the scenes various math formulas (dice rolling) in conjunction with various skills and strengths will go into determining how one performs in a battle / fighting scene.

NOTES:

- Yarrow is a large island
  - It will have all of the various terrain types
    - Mountains
    - Rivers
    - Lakes
    - Hills
    - Forests

- City names:
  - Irdana: The closest town to the characters starting position
  - Maria
  - Sonara
  - Tempor
  - Felmon
  - Brenna

- Setting: There will be modern aspects such as clothing and lifestyle that feels as though it could exist in the 21st century but the game will play like a fantasy role playing game in the style of old school RPGs but without graphics.

#Island of Yarrow

Yarrow is a wonderful island with breathtaking mountains, valleys, hills,
forests, lakes, rivers and most of all beaches. When the weather is optimal
the skies are the most vivid blues you can imagine and the clouds are the most
fluffiest white wisps that float through the heavens.

#City of Irdana

Irdana is a medium sized coastal town positioned near the Wispful bay. The town is modest
in size and has all of the standard sort of amenities that you'd expect to find. There
are pubs, places to rest, places to worship, places for magic, places to learn, etc...

- Medium sized town
- Monestary w/ Priests home next to it (small houses 2 - 4 priests)
- Pub
- Inn
- Botanical w/ 1 botanist and 1 apprentice NPC
- Magic guild w/ 4 magician NPCs
- Fighters guild w/ 4 fighter NPCs
- A few random houses for NPCs
- Fountain in the center of town
- Cobblestone and dirt roads
- Small port for supply ships and fishing vessels
- The town has a lot of character to it, there are lots of colorful flowers/plants around

##Botanical

The botanical contains a building suitable for housing the botanist and her apprentice as
well as working with plants in order to plant them in the garden. There are a number of plants
within the building in various stages of development. The botanist and her apprentice take their
work very seriously. They have a special room which houses magical plants used for creating
potions and spells.

##Monestary

The Monestary is modest in size and reflects the nature of the town of Irdana.
To the left of the Monestary lays a stable and a small home for the priests. The outside
of the buildings are decorated with wild flowers of all sorts (very colorful and beautiful).

##Small Port

Irana sits on the Wispful bay. The waters are deep blue and the beaches are perfect for relaxing.
A small port capable of supporting supply ships and fishing vessels lays on the east of town.
