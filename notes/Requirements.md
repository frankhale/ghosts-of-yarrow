Requirements:

NOTE: Okay so I am seriously influenced by games in the series of The Elder Scrolls, Ultima 4 and 5
and I'll likely incorporate some of those aspects here.

- Free roaming
	- Internally the map will be 2D top down and act like an old school RPG but the player won't see a map, instead only see text to let him know what is going on in the game.
- Player leveling
	- Skills:
		- Meditation
		- Pick Pocket / Theft
		- Bribery
		- Magic
- Lots of items to find, receive as a reward or buy
- No limit to how much loot the player can carry
- Dungeons, caves, camps
* Time system (think of how time was kept in Ultima 4 or 5, not real time, events can be triggered based on time)
- Battle system
	- Will work similiar to how battles worked in Lord of Ultima. Behind the scenes various math formulas (dice rolling) in conjunction with various skills and strengths will go into determining how one performs in a battle / fighting scene. 

NOTES:

- Yarrow is a large island
	- It will have all of the various terrain types
		- Mountains
		- Rivers
		- Lakes
		- Hills
		- Forests

- City names:
	- Irdana: The closest town to the characters starting position
	- Maria
	- Sonara
	- Tempor
	- Felmon
	- Brenna
	
- Setting: There will be modern aspects such as clothing and lifestyle that feels as though it could exist in the 21st century but the game will play like a fantasy role playing game in the style of old school RPGs but without graphics.
