#City of Irdana

Irdana is a small coastal town positioned near the Wispful bay. The town is modest
in size and has all of the standard sort of amenities that you'd expect to find. There
are pubs, places to rest, places to worship, places for magic, places to learn, etc...

##Monestary

The Monestary is modest in size and reflects the small nature of the town of Irdana. 
To the left of the Monestary lays a stable and a small home for the priests. The outside
of the buildings are decorated with wild flowers of all sorts.
