#The Ghosts of Yarrow

###NOTE: Picture the land and scenery as if it were rendered in the style of The Elder Scrolls Oblivion. The scenery is absolutely beautiful and luscious.

This is a placeholder for developing the storyline to my text adventure game 
under the same title as this file. Additionally this will outline the 
requirements and various aspects of the game.

As I think about this more and more I assume that this file will be bits of 
fragments and ideas because the story won't necessarily read like a book. There 
will be twists and turns and side quests and such.

Need to figure out a way to create a map that can be easily changed and 
prototyped here. I guess I'll just have to use text but maybe there is something
else I can use? Having a map of Yarrow will help in figuring out the story
locations.

~~Actually come to think of it I think I'll hand draw a map and just scan it in
as a graphic.~~

###NOTE: This isn't necessarily meant to read from top to bottom.

You find yourself in the middle of a field, it's nighttime and you don't 
remember how you got here. The summer moon is full and it's light fills the 
cloudless sky. You notice that the strong illumination of the moon allows you 
to see fairly well. You look around and to your east, west and south lay a 
treeline approximately 100 yards away. To your north you see a series of lights 
that may be coming from a village. They seem farther than the woodline, maybe 
4 or 5 times as far. Judging from the well light area the ground appears to be 
fairly flat with 2 - 3 foot tall grass at least in your immediate area.

A short fat candle at your feet. 

You are dressed in casual clothing wearing jeans, a t-shirt, a pair of boots 
and carrying a backpack.

You take your backpack off to examine the contents of it. Within it you find a 
lighter, a cloth, a map, 10 gold coins and some small food items and a bottle 
of water.

Walking towards the lights to your north took approximately 15 - 20 minutes due 
to your uneasiness with the terrain and the fact that it's night. The bright 
luminance of the moon was not enough to ease your weariness as you travesed the 
land. Your suspicions of the lights being from a village are correct. You stand 
approximately 100 feet from a row of buildings and you can see the lights 
shining from windows and street lights.

Your quest is to rescue sacred artifacts left by 8 members of Yarrow's high 
council. These men and women died in a horrendous attack against the sovereignty 
and liberty of Yarrow and are said to be haunting various locations around the 
island. The attack was expertly crafted and executed leaving no trace to track 
down the perpetrators. You'll need to locate the haunted areas and trace down 
the clues that will lead to the lost artifacts. Once equipped with the 
artifacts you'll need to take them to the high cleric so that they can be used 
in an ancient ritual seance in order to communicate with the martyred high 
council members so that the individuals who caused the heinous act can be 
brought to justice. 

You'll need to earn some money so you can buy supplies.

You'll need to find a place where you can sleep at night.

You'll need to conquer the skill of meditation. This will be vital in allowing
you to open yourself up to receive information about your quest.

The lights you suspected were a city, were indeed a city and it's a good thing 
because you are tired and need to rest. You'll need to look for a safe place
to sleep. Head for the monastery, I'm sure they will have warm place for you
to rest.

You've found the town of Irdana. 

Irdana is a small coastal town positioned near the Wispful bay.

Explore the town and talk to as many people as you can. Find out as much 
information as you need to get you started on your quest.

##The Woodline South Of The Players Starting Point

You turn south and start walking through the tall grass. You walk about 25 yards
and notice that your feet are starting to get wet. The ground is very wet in this 
location. It's perhaps 1 and a half feet deep. Do you want to continue on or turn 
around and play it safe or continue on?

###NOTE

*The woodline to the south has a swampy area which is in front of it. If the 
player continues and makes the trek through the swampy area then he will eventually
come out of it and reach the forest. About 30 feet within the woodline is a hollowed
out tree which leads to a chamber that contains valuable items that the player will
surely want for his journey.*

If the player continues south passed the hollowed out tree he will come to a beach
because the players starting position is on a small peninsula.

##To the East and West of the Starting Position

The player can travel to his east or west from the starting position. If he does he
will encounter a grassy area similiar to his starting position followed by the woodline.
If he travels through the woodline he'll come to a beach because the area that the player
starts is on a small peninsula.
